		<h1>Intellectual Proberty</h1>
		<h2>I</h2>
	<p>
		Personally I think that Intellectual proberty should be protected and that the pirates should be stopped, If a bussiness wants protection and wants there ideas and innovations to stay private so that no one else could use it then they have the right. At the end of the day the originall ideas that a bussiness has ii what makes it more successful and they should have the right to maintain there individuality and there identity through there Ideas or innovation. My solution will be adressing copy right and the pirates who steal  other peoples work.
